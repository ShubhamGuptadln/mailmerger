# mailmerger
In this project we are going to make a simple backend coding of a very popular thing known as mailmerger in which we have to change only few things liker name and address and remaining all things will be same  so what we have to do is to change that particular word and sentence only. All the coding is done in python 
Here we are having a message.txt file in which message is already there which we have to sent to many people.
We have also a guestlist file which contain the name of the guests on whom we have to deliver the messages
